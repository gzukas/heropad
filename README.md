<h1 align="center">Heropad</h1>

Heropad is an experimental full-stack application that visualizes social links. Designed as a **foundational app**, Heropad provides a starting point for exploring dynamic relationships in a network and can be extended for similar applications. It offers a way to understand the interconnectedness between heroes and the awards they have earned, providing valuable insights through an interactive sociogram.

Please note that all hero names and awards are entirely fictional and bear no resemblance to real-world.
